                    # coorelation matrix used in question 3 to determine which

                    # A correlation value greater than 'pthreshold' is required

                    # simi-regular basis by a user group as new data becomes
                    # available. As such, the potential is that the correlation 
                    # associated with variables is subject to change and the 
                    # threshold to participate may change. 
                    #
                    # 'pthreshold' is made visible here in the yaml code such 
                    # that the user does not have to dive into the code to make  
                    # adhoc changes when re-knitting this file for new data.
