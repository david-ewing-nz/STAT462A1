# Braking Distance

In this question, do not use the `lm` function or a module that provides an implementation of k-NN. You are allowed to use elementary statistical objects like mean, variance, etc.

We will be predicting the distance that a car takes to stop when driving at a certain speed. The dataset is from 1930, so it might be slightly outdated. Units are miles per hour (speed) and feet (distance).

## Data Preparation

```{r}
# Load and preprocess dataset
```

## Linear Regression (Without lm)

```{r}
# Compute slope and intercept for simple linear regression
```

Using the linear regression model, predict the braking distance for a car going at 30 km/h and include an 80% prediction interval.

```{r}
# Prediction for 30 km/h
```

## k-NN Model

```{r}
# Fit and predict using k-NN model
```

## Data Preparation

```{r}
# Load and preprocess dataset
```


## Linear Regression

```{r}
# Fit linear model and summarise
```

# ---------------------------
# Predicting Possum Age
## Data Preparation

```{r load-possums, include=FALSE}
# Load and preprocess dataset
 zip_path <- "../data/datasets.zip"
 file.exists(zip_path)
 possums <- read.csv(unz(zip_path, "possums.csv"))
 head(possums)
```

## Data and Initial Analysis

```{r possum-map, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
# Load dataset and visualise
knitr::include_graphics("../images/possum_age_plot.png")
## Data Preparation


```

```{r}
# Preprocess dataset
```

## Feature Selection and Model Training

```{r}
# Forward feature selection and model training
```

## Model Evaluation

```{r}
# Compute evaluation metrics
```

## Further Exploration

```{r}
# Additional analysis or research questions
```
