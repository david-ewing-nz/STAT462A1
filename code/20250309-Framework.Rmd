# Braking Distance

In this question, do not use the `lm` function or a module that provides an implementation of k-NN. You are allowed to use elementary statistical objects like mean, variance, etc.

We will be predicting the distance that a car takes to stop when driving at a certain speed. The dataset is from 1930, so it might be slightly outdated. Units are miles per hour (speed) and feet (distance).

## Data Preparation

```{r}
# Load and preprocess dataset
```

## Linear Regression (Without lm)

```{r}
# Compute slope and intercept for simple linear regression
```

Using the linear regression model, predict the braking distance for a car going at 30 km/h and include an 80% prediction interval.

```{r}
# Prediction for 30 km/h
```

## k-NN Model

```{r}
# Fit and predict using k-NN model
```
