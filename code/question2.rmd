## Linear Regression

### Training Set And Testing Set Preparation

```{r training-data-and-testing-data-setup, include=TRUE, eval=T}
# Function to split data into training and test sets
split_data <- function(data, train_ratio = 0.8) {
  # Randomly select the specified percentage of indices for the training set
  train_ind <- sample(1:nrow(data), size = train_ratio * nrow(data))
  
  # Use the remaining indices for the test set
  test_ind <- setdiff(1:nrow(data), train_ind)
  
  # Create training data using the selected indices
  train_data <- data[train_ind, ]
  
  # Create test data using the remaining indices
  test_data <- data[test_ind, ]
  
  # Return both training and test data as a list
  return(list(train = train_data, test = test_data))
}

# Call the function with a 70% training set and 30% test set
xsplit_data <- split_data(income_1, train_ratio = 0.8)

# Access the training and testing sets
xtrain_data <- xsplit_data$train
xtest_data <- xsplit_data$test
```

### Model Training

```{r SLR model fiting, include=TRUE, eval=T}
# fit a linear regression model
model <- lm(income ~ children, data = xtrain_data)

# print the summary of the model
summary(model)
```

### Model Explanation

The specific form of this model is expressed as: $income =b_0 + b_1 \cdot children + \epsilon$

-   $b_0$ (intercept): Represents the predicted income when the number of children is zero.

-   $b_1$ (slope): Indicates the change in income for each additional child.

-   $\epsilon$ (a mean-zero random error term): “The error term is a catch-all for what we miss with this simple model: the true relationship is probably not linear, there may be other variables that cause variation in Y( here Y means $income$ ) , and there may be measurement error. We typically assume that the error term is independent of X(here X means $children$ ).” (James et al., 2021, p. 63)

-   Each computed on the basis of a separate random set of observations, is different. (James et al., 2021, p. 64) With different seed number, which was set as $62380486$ at very beginning, the $b_0$ and $b_1$ vary within a intervals.

```{r print b0 and b1}
# coefficients

# b_0 intercept
b_0 <- coef(model)[1]  
# b_1 slope
b_1 <- coef(model)[2]  

cat("b[0] = ", b_0, "\n", "b[1] = ", b_1)
```

The predicted mean income of a household with $𝑛$ children, for $n \in \{0,1,…,8\}$

```{r xtrain_pred, include=TRUE,eval=T}
# Define variables
n <- 0:8  # n is defined as a vector

# predicted mean income of a household with n children
xtrain_pred <- b_0 + b_1 * n 
# print(xtrain_pred)
```

The associated 90% prediction intervals caculation

$\text{Residual Standard Error (RSE)}$

$\tau = t_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}} \cdot \text{RSE}$

$\text{prediction intervals} = \hat{y} \pm \tau$

$\text{lower bound} = \hat{y} - \tau$

$\text{upper bound} = \hat{y}+\tau$

```{r prediction intervals, include=TRUE,eval=T}
# Compute true mean income for each n from train_data
true_income_mean <- tapply(income_1$income, income_1$children, mean)
print(true_income_mean)

# Get residual standard error from model summary
residual_se <- summary(model)$sigma  # Residual standard error

# Find critical value for 90% prediction interval
alpha <- 0.1
t_crit <- qt(1 - alpha/2, df = summary(model)$df[2])  # Two-tailed t-value
tau <- t_crit * residual_se
# Compute the 90% prediction interval bounds
lower_bound <- xtrain_pred - tau
upper_bound <- xtrain_pred + tau
```

***3.b.3 Summarize all of above information in a table.***

```{r table, include=TRUE, eval=T, echo=FALSE}
# Create a data frame
xtest_results <- data.frame(
  n = n, 
  xtrain_pred,
  true_income_mean,
  lower_90 = lower_bound, 
  upper_90 = upper_bound
)


# Create a flextable with custom headers
set_flextable_defaults(
    font.size = 8, 
    theme_fun = theme_vanilla,
    padding = 6,
    background.color = "#EFEFEF")

ft_test <- flextable(xtest_results) |>
  set_header_labels(
    n = "Children",
    true_income_mean = "True Mean Income",
    xtrain_pred = "Predicted Mean Income",
    lower_90 = "Lower Bound (90% PI)",
    upper_90 = "Upper Bound (90% PI)"
  )|>
align(align = "center", part = "all") |>
autofit()  # Adjust column sizes automatically

  
# Print the table
ft_test
```

***3.c.1 Using your test set, check how many percent of data points lie within the 90% prediction intervals.***

To check how many data points in the test set fall within the 90% prediction intervals, we need to:

1\. Predict income for xtest_data`$`children using the model.

2\. Compute the 90% prediction interval for each prediction.

3\. Count the number of test points where xtest_data`$`income falls inside the interval.

4\. Calculate the percentage of test points that satisfy this condition.

```{r }
# Predict income for the test set
xtest_pred <- predict(model, newdata = xtest_data, se.fit = TRUE, interval = "prediction", level = 0.90)

# Extract the predicted values from the result of `predict()`, fit[,1]
xpredicted_values <- xtest_pred$fit[, 1]

# Compute prediction interval bounds from fit[,2] and fit[,3]
xlower_bound_test <- xtest_pred$fit[,2]
xupper_bound_test <- xtest_pred$fit[,3]

# Check if test set income values fall within the interval
xwithin_interval <- (xtest_data$income >= xlower_bound_test) & (xtest_data$income <= xupper_bound_test)

# Calculate percentage of points within the interval
percentage_within <- mean(xwithin_interval) * 100 


# Print xresult
cat("Percentage of test points within the 90% prediction interval:", percentage_within, "%\n")
```

4.  Do all steps of part 3. again, but this time you will be predicting log_income = log(income) instead of income.
